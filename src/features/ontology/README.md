feature: ontology
status: active
purpose: Create, inspect, document, import, JSON/OWL export, and visualize ontology documents, modules, classes, relations, and attributes.
scope:
  - ontology document import and selection
  - ontology document JSON and OWL export with dependency review
  - module create, import, export, rename, duplicate, and delete flows
  - module, class, relation, and attribute metadata authoring
  - class, relation, relation attribute, and attribute CRUD
  - browser/detail views and React Flow canvas state
  - persisted layout and class-position state for visual mode and JSON round-trips
  - AI-assisted ontology draft generation and staged review from competency questions
  - reference vocabularies and standard ontology indexing (OLS4 & LOV)
  - zero-cost local vector similarity matching and semantic entity alignment
entry_points:
  - path: src/app/ontology/page.tsx
    purpose: Server route that resolves the active ontology document and initial data.
  - path: src/features/ontology/components/ontology-shell/ontology-shell.tsx
    purpose: Client shell that coordinates browser, detail, visual, and ontology metadata dialog regions.
server_entry_points:
  - path: src/features/ontology/server/queries/
    purpose: Focused read layer and client-callable query functions for ontology documents, structure, metadata, reference ontologies, and saved layout state.
  - path: src/features/ontology/server/actions/
    purpose: Focused write actions for ontology CRUD, JSON import/export, module transfer, visual layout persistence, and reference vocabularies sync.
  - path: src/features/ontology/server/actions/generate-ontology.ts
    purpose: AI-assisted ontology draft generation from competency questions with local vector grounding, contextual expansion, and transactional persistence.

# Ontology

## Domain Concepts

- `ontology document`: top-level ontology version loaded in the feature
- `group scope`: every ontology document belongs to one access group and is only visible within that group
- `shared workspace`: unprotected local mode and protected shared-password mode use `shared`; configured password groups remain separate
- `module`: group of related ontology classes inside a document, with its own overview metadata surface
- `class`: entity type definition used by documents and relations
- `attribute`: structured field attached to a class
- `relation`: typed edge between a domain class and a range class
- `relation attribute`: structured field attached to a relation/fact edge
- `localized text`: editor-only translation for ontology metadata fields
- `note`: timestamped, author-labelled annotation attached to ontology, module, class, relation, CQ, or attribute targets
- `example`: sample value or triple attached to class, relation, CQ, or attribute targets; class and relation examples can be marked as allowed candidates and CQs can pin subject, predicate, and object examples
- `class position`: saved node position for visual mode
- `module layout`: saved module bounds for the canvas
- `export dependency`: class or relation reference that crosses the current export selection and needs an explicit decision
- `reference ontology`: external vocabulary or standard ontology (e.g. SOSA/SSN, ENVO, Schema.org) cached locally from OLS4/LOV
- `vector alignment`: zero-cost local 384-d semantic embedding matching suggesting reuse, subClassOf, or equivalence for entities
- `contextual graph closure`: Option B automatic discovery of direct parents and linked relations for adopted standard terms

## Flow

1. `src/app/ontology/page.tsx` resolves the active ontology document and its related data on the server.
2. `OntologyShell` switches between browser mode and visual mode while keeping module and selection state local.
3. `module-tab-bar.tsx` handles module switching plus module-scoped overview, create/import, rename, duplicate, export, and delete actions.
4. `left-browser-panel.tsx` wraps class, relation, and reference standard vocabulary browsing through `EntityTypeTabs` when the shell is in browser mode.
5. `visual-region.tsx` renders `OntologyCanvas` for React Flow editing and selection when the shell is in visual mode, including class example previews on nodes and selected relation example previews on edges.
   Manual node and module moves stay local in the canvas state immediately and persist in the background without re-fitting the viewport on each drag save.
6. `ontology-header.tsx` handles ontology creation, JSON import, import-format guidance, and export dialog entry points.
7. `selection.ts` resolves class/relation selections, while `OntologyShell` also tracks explicit module overview selection.
8. `detail-panel-shell.tsx` hosts tabbed class, relation, or module detail views with metadata editors for translations, notes, examples, instance rules, relation attributes, and inline competency-question authoring in the ontology details dialog.
9. Server actions persist ontology structure changes, metadata rows, saved visual layout state, JSON round-trips, and OWL export generation.

## Constraints

- when a component needs subcomponents, prefer a folder like `components/<name>/<name>.tsx` for new work and keep related parts in separate files
- all server reads and writes in this feature must stay scoped to the current access group via the root `ontology document`
